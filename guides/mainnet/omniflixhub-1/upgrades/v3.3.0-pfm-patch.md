## Upgrade details 
  - upgrade height: `11140000`

  - upgrade type: co-ordinated halt-height upgrade
  
  more than 2/3 of the validators needs to upgrade their nodes from `v3.1.x` to `v3.3.0`


## Manual Steps 

### Step 1: setting halt-height and restarting node  (follow this instructions before halt height)
there are two mutually exclusive options for this stage:
**Option 1: Set the halt height by modifying app.toml**
 - stop the omniflixhubd process
   ```
   sudo systemctl stop omniflixhubd.service
   ```
 - set the halt-height in `~/.omniflixhub/config/app.toml`
   ```
   halt-height = 11140000
   ```
 - Update `Restart=no` in your service file to make sure service doesn't restart after halt height  
 - reload & restart the omniflixhubd process
   ```
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart omniflixhubd.service
   ```
 - wait for the upgrade height and confirm that the node is halted

**Option 2:  Restart the serivce/node with command line flags**
 - stop the omniflixhubd process
   ```
   sudo systemctl stop omniflixhubd.service
   ```
 - add halt-height flag for start command
   ```
   omniflixhubd start --halt-height 11140000
   
   or
   cosmovisor start --halt-height 11140000
   ```
 - Update `Restart=no` to make sure service doesn't restart after halt height
 - reload the daemon and restart the service
 ---


### Step 2: Restart node with patched version v3.3.0 (follow this upgrade step only after halt-height is reached)
**1) Install patched version**
```bash
cd omniflixhub
git fetch --tags && git checkout v3.3.0
make build && make install
```
 
check version `omniflixhubd version --long`
```
commit: ea7887c1db69c84e46a5108a0c5e53e22a5646cb
cosmos_sdk_version: v0.47.10
go: go version go1.21.3 linux/amd64
name: OmniFlixHub
server_name: omniflixhubd
version: v3.3.0
```
**if you're running node with cosmovisor**
copy the binary to v3 folder
```
cp ~/go/bin/omniflixhubd ~/.omniflixhub/cosmovisor/upgrades/v3/bin/omniflixuhbd
```
check version (should retrun `v3.3.0`)
```
cosmovisor version
```

**2) Update config before restart**
- set `halt-height = 0` in `~/.omniflixhub/config/app.toml`
- remove `halt-height` command line flag (if you used option 2)
- set `Restart=on-failure` or `Restart=always` in service file
- reload the the daemon
  ```
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  ```

**3) Restart node**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start omniflixhubd.service
   ```


**4) check the running node version**
The output for the below command should include `version : 3.3.0` if everything goes well:
```
curl localhost:26657/abci_info -s
```
